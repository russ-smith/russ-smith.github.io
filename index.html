		<h2>About me</h2>
        	<p>Hi. I'm Russ Smith. Welcome to my page.</p>
		<p>I'm a programmer with an interest in games, graphics, audio, and all things mathematical and multimedia-based. </p>
		<p>I'm currently working at startup Zulleon in Dublin, helping to build the OOKs brand for kids. While here, I've helped build and ship a collection of mobile games, and update and maintain our backend selling merch based on user-generated content.</p>
		<p>Before that, I spent two years living  in Shanghai, where I worked at a young, mid-sized indie games company. I worked mainly on graphics-related tasks for our main project, a networked racing game, but I was also responsible for prototyping various side projects, none of which saw the light of day unfortunately.</p>
		<p>For my last year there, I also taught programming to Chinese kids in weekend and summer classes, using Python to demonstrate the basic concepts and create simple projects, including clones of a few classic games.</p>
		<p>On this site, you can find some examples of my <a href="work.html#content">previous work</a>, some <a href="personal.html#content">personal projects</a> I've been working on, and <a href = "links.html#content">links</a> to my email, C.V. and other stuff around the web. </p>
